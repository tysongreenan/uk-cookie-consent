## 🟡 Minor Gaps & Potential Enhancements

### 1. **Consent Withdrawal Feature**
**Blog Promise:** "Easy way to withdraw consent later"

**Current Status:** ⚠️ **Partially Implemented**
- ✅ Users can click "Preferences" to reopen banner
- 🟡 Could be more prominent with a persistent "Cookie Settings" link

**Recommendation:** Add a floating "Cookie Settings" button option or footer link generator

---

### 2. **Language Support**
**Blog Mention:** "Auto language detection (English + French support coming)"

**Current Status:** ⚠️ **Not Yet Implemented**
- 🔴 Currently English only
- 🔴 No French translation for Quebec compliance (Law 25 requirement)

**Recommendation:** Add French translation support for Quebec compliance

---

### 3. **Record Keeping**
**Blog Recommendation:** "Keep records of consent"

**Current Status:** ⚠️ **Basic Implementation**
- ✅ Consent stored in localStorage
- 🟡 No server-side audit trail or reporting dashboard

**Recommendation:** Add consent analytics dashboard showing:
- How many users accepted vs rejected
- Which categories are most accepted
- Consent trends over time

---

### 4. **Pre-Written Legal Templates**
**Homepage Claim:** "~~Prewritten legal templates~~ for GDPR, PIPEDA, CASL"

**Current Status:** ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED** (Already removed from homepage)
- 🔴 No legal privacy policy templates provided
- 🔴 No cookie policy generator

**Recommendation:** Either:
1. Add basic privacy policy templates (with disclaimer)
2. Continue not claiming this feature (current approach)

---

### 5. **Consent Management Platform (CMP) Features**
**Industry Standard (Not Promised):**

**Current Status:** ⚠️ **Basic Implementation**
