# Clean Up Duplicate Workspaces

## Problem
The auth logic was creating a new workspace **every time you logged in** instead of only on first signup. This created hundreds of duplicate "Sway's Team" workspaces.

## Solution

### Step 1: Run the SQL cleanup script

1. Open your Supabase project
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `cleanup-duplicate-workspaces.sql`
4. Execute the script

This will:
- Delete all duplicate workspaces (keeping only the oldest one)
- Update your user record to point to the correct workspace
- Clean up orphaned team memberships

### Step 2: Restart your dev server

The auth logic has been fixed to prevent future duplicates by:
- Double-checking if the user already has ANY teams before creating a new one
- Reusing existing teams if found
- Only creating a new workspace if the user truly has zero teams

### Step 3: Test

1. Log out and log back in
2. Check the workspace switcher - you should now see only ONE "Sway's Workspace"
3. The duplicate creation bug is now fixed!

## What was fixed

**Before:** Every login would create a new workspace because the initial query didn't find teamMember (due to query issues), triggering workspace creation every time.

**After:** The code now double-checks for existing teams before creating a new one, preventing duplicates.
