# Security Implementation Guide

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. **Replace Existing Team API Routes** (CRITICAL - Do This First)

**Current Issue**: Team API routes lack proper authentication and authorization checks.

**Action Required**:
```bash
# Backup existing routes
mv app/api/teams/[teamId]/route.ts app/api/teams/[teamId]/route.ts.backup
mv app/api/teams/[teamId]/members/[memberId]/route.ts app/api/teams/[teamId]/members/[memberId]/route.ts.backup

# Replace with secure versions
cp app/api/teams/[teamId]/secure-route.ts app/api/teams/[teamId]/route.ts
```

**Why Critical**: Users can currently access/modify teams they don't belong to.

### 2. **Update Stripe Webhook Handler** (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Current Issue**: Webhook lacks payment amount validation and duplicate event protection.

**Action Required**:
```bash
# Backup existing webhook
mv app/api/upgrade/webhook/route.ts app/api/upgrade/webhook/route.ts.backup

# Replace with secure version
cp app/api/upgrade/secure-webhook/route.ts app/api/upgrade/webhook/route.ts
```

**Why Critical**: Prevents payment fraud and unauthorized upgrades.

### 3. **Add Security Headers to All API Routes**

**Action Required**: Add to every API route:
```typescript
import { SECURITY_HEADERS } from '@/lib/security-validation'

// Add to all responses
return NextResponse.json(data, { headers: SECURITY_HEADERS })
```

3. **Implement data retention policies**
4. **Create data export functionality**

### Step 3: Advanced Security (Next Week)

1. **Add rate limiting** to all API routes
2. **Implement security monitoring**
3. **Add audit logging** for all operations
4. **Create incident response procedures**

## üìä SECURITY METRICS TO TRACK

- Suspicious payment activity
- Rate limit violations
- XSS attacks

**Medium (Response Time: 24 hours)**
- Failed authentication spikes
- Unusual team access patterns
- Input validation failures
- GDPR compliance issues

### Response Procedures

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Notify security team
   - Document incident

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze logs and metrics
   - Identify attack vector
