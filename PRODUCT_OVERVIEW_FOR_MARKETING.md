# Product Overview: Privacy-First Analytics Platform
## Marketing Brief for Website Development

---

## 🎯 **What We Sell**

**Cookie-Banner.ca** is a **privacy-first analytics platform** that gives marketing teams their traffic back through server-side measurement. We move analytics into your server container—supporting Google Consent Mode V2—ensuring legal compliance and future-proofing against the end of third-party cookies.

**The Problem We Solve:** Cookie banners are killing marketing analytics. Users reject cookies, and marketers lose visibility. We solve this by moving measurement server-side, giving you back 100% of your traffic data—all before it touches any analytics platform.
