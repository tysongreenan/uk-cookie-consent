# Don't Make Me Think - Landing Page Framework

## The Complete Framework for High-Converting Landing Pages

This document combines Steve Krug's usability principles, Alex Hormozi's offer psychology, Gary Vee's value-first marketing, and conversion copywriting best practices.

---

## 1. Don't Make Me Think

**Krug's Principle:** A website should be instantly understandable. The user shouldn't have to pause to figure things out.

**Example (Success):**
- "Add to Cart" button instead of "Submit."
- Search bar in top-right where people expect it.

**Hormozi's Take:**
He'd say: "Don't just remove friction — remove doubt." If a user thinks "Will this work for me?" you already lost them. Make the value and guarantee so obvious that no thought is required.

- Add a guarantee right under the CTA ("30-Day Free Trial. Cancel Anytime").
- Show risk reversal ("If it doesn't work, you don't pay").

**Gary Vee's Perspective:**
Gary frames it as give-first clarity. Don't make the user think if you're trustworthy. Prove it upfront with value:

- Free tools, guides, or insights before you ever ask.
- The "take" (buy, signup) feels natural because you've built equity.

**Copywriter Notes:**
CTAs must combine clarity + outcome:

- Bad: "Submit."
- Good: "Get My Free Audit."
- Best: "Start Doubling My Leads Today."

## 2. How People Really Use the Web

**Krug's Principle:** Users scan, not read. They satisfice (choose the first "good enough" option) and act impulsively.

**Example (Success):**
- Bulleted benefits with bold words.
- Hero section with CTA upfront.

**Hormozi's Take:**
You have 3–5 seconds to prove value. He'd say: "Your headline must be the offer distilled." Example:

- "Add 50 New Leads in 30 Days — Guaranteed."
- Don't bury value in paragraph #3.

**Gary Vee's Perspective:**
Gary says jabs must be quick hits of value. A busy user should walk away with something useful even if they never click. Example:

- "3 mistakes costing you leads (and how to fix them)" in bold bullets.

**Copywriter Notes:**
- Make subheads standalone. Each section should sell the offer even if skimmed.
- Use bold benefit language: "Cut costs 30% in 90 days."
- Repeat CTA buttons every 2–3 scrolls.

---

## 3. Conventions Are Your Friends

**Krug's Principle:** Stick with what users know. Don't invent new patterns.

**Example (Success):**
- Logo links to homepage.
- Cart icon top right.
- Underlined links.

**Hormozi's Take:**
He'd warn: "Novelty kills conversion." The offer is where you innovate, not the UI. Keep navigation familiar so the brain can focus on the pitch.

**Gary Vee's Perspective:**
Gary would say: Don't waste jabs on teaching navigation. Save the value for your message, not interface quirks.

**Copywriter Notes:**
On funnel/landing pages:
- Kill mega menus.
- Use minimal nav (Home | About | Contact | CTA).
- Every nav option should support conversion — or be removed.

---

## 4. Visual Hierarchy Matters

**Krug's Principle:** Use size, color, and placement to show what matters most.

**Example (Success):**
- Bold hero headline.
- Bright CTA button.
- Secondary text in muted color.

**Hormozi's Take:**
Hierarchy must emphasize perceived value. For example:
- Huge stat: "+47% Growth."
- CTA button directly under it.
- He'd also add value anchoring (pricing tables, guarantee badges).

**Gary Vee's Perspective:**
The headline = biggest jab. It should give something upfront ("Here's how to fix X problem today") before you ask for the click.

**Copywriter Notes:**
- Every scroll section = one big promise, one clear CTA.
- Don't bury benefits in body text — pull them up visually.

---

## 5. Make Clicks Mindless

**Krug's Principle:** Every click should be obvious and predictable.

**Example (Success):**
- "Sign up with Google" vs 6-step form.
- Filters update instantly, no page reload.

**Hormozi's Take:**
Clicks = micro-commitments. Reduce steps. Each action builds momentum.
- Step 1: Enter email.
- Step 2: Confirm free trial.
- Step 3: Enjoy product.

**Gary Vee's Perspective:**
Give, give, give — so when you finally "ask" for a click, it feels earned. The click becomes the right hook after 3 jabs of free value.

**Copywriter Notes:**
Every button must spell outcome:
- "Book Call."
- "Download Free Guide."
- "Get Instant Access."

## 6. Eliminate Unnecessary Words

**Krug's Principle:** Cut filler. Less talk, more clarity.

**Example (Success):**
- Instead of: "We aim to deliver excellence…"
- Say: "Fast. Reliable. Guaranteed."

**Hormozi's Take:**
Every word must either increase perceived value or remove friction. If not, delete.

**Gary Vee's Perspective:**
Jabs must be fast and consumable. Wordiness wastes jabs — people stop listening.

**Copywriter Notes:**
- Audit copy: highlight words that don't sell. Delete half.
- Keep short, punchy sentences.

---

## 7. Make Navigation Obvious

**Krug's Principle:** Users must always know where they are, where to go, and how to return.

**Example (Success):**
- Breadcrumb trail: Home > Blog > Article.
- Highlighted menu tab for current page.

**Hormozi's Take:**
Navigation = part of funnel. Too many options → decision fatigue. Guide them toward the offer.

**Gary Vee's Perspective:**
If they can't easily find your jabs (value sections), they won't stick around long enough for the hook. Navigation = trust builder.

**Copywriter Notes:**
- Use anchor links for long sales pages ("Jump to Pricing").
- On high-conversion pages, limit navigation to essentials.

---

## 8. The Home Page Matters

**Krug's Principle:** It should clearly state what you are, what you do, and where to start.

**Example (Success):**
- Hero: "Simple Project Management for Teams."
- Subhead: "Plan, track, and hit deadlines together."
- CTA: "Try Free."

**Hormozi's Take:**
Positioning + proof + offer = irresistible home page.
- Who it's for.
- What they get.
- Why you're credible.

**Gary Vee's Perspective:**
Homepage = your biggest jab. Give them content, free insights, clarity before you ask for anything.

**Copywriter Notes:**
Hero formula: Audience + Outcome + Proof + CTA.
E.g., "For small business owners: Double your leads in 90 days. Trusted by 500+."

---

## 9. Usability Testing

**Krug's Principle:** Test early, test often. Real users show issues you can't see.

**Example (Success):**
- Users can't find "Pricing" under "About." → Move it to main nav.

**Hormozi's Take:**
Track metrics, watch drop-offs, iterate quickly. Don't over-plan — improve via testing.

**Gary Vee's Perspective:**
Testing = listening. Watch how people respond to your jabs before throwing the hook. Market feedback matters more than your opinion.

**Copywriter Notes:**
- Test headlines: "Save 50%" vs "Double Your Output."
- Run A/B tests for CTA placement and copy.

---

## 10. Accessibility & Simplicity

**Krug's Principle:** Sites should work for everyone, across devices and abilities.

**Example (Success):**
- Alt text for images.
- Mobile-friendly forms.
- Large, readable fonts.

**Hormozi's Take:**
Simplicity = conversions. Remove complexity, increase action.

**Gary Vee's Perspective:**
Accessibility = scale. If someone can't consume your value (bad mobile UX, tiny fonts), you've lost a jab before you even asked.

**Copywriter Notes:**
- Test on mobile first.
- Keep forms <3 fields.
- Avoid jargon in body copy.
