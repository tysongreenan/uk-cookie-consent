## What Canadian Privacy Laws Require Cookie Consent?

Canadian websites must comply with three main privacy laws that require cookie consent:

### What Is PIPEDA and How Does It Apply to Cookies?

PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) is Canada's federal privacy law that applies to private-sector organizations. Under PIPEDA, you must:

- Get **meaningful consent** before collecting personal information
- Explain **why** you're collecting data and **how** you'll use it
- Give users control over their data
- Protect personal information with appropriate safeguards

**What this means for cookies:** If your cookies collect personal information (like IP addresses, device IDs, or browsing behavior), you need explicit consent. Learn more about [PIPEDA requirements from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/).

### What Is CASL and How Does It Apply to Cookies?

CASL (Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation) primarily deals with email marketing, but it also applies to tracking technologies. Key requirements:

- Get consent before installing software (including tracking scripts) on someone's device
- Clearly identify your organization
- Provide an easy way to opt-out

**What this means for cookies:** Marketing and advertising cookies fall under CASL's "software" definition. Read the [official CASL guidance](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/030.nsf/eng/home).

### What Is Quebec's Law 25 and How Is It Different?

Quebec has its own privacy law, Bill 64 (Law 25), which is even stricter than PIPEDA:

- Requires **explicit consent** for cookies (not just implied)
- Mandates **opt-in** (not opt-out) for non-essential cookies
- Includes **significant fines** for non-compliance

If you have users in Quebec, you need to follow the stricter standard. Learn more about [Quebec's Law 25 requirements](https://www.quebec.ca/en/government/departments-and-agencies/justice/access-to-information-and-privacy).

## What Types of Cookies Require Consent in Canada?

Understanding cookie categories is crucial for Canadian compliance. Here's a breakdown of what requires consent and what doesn't:

### Do Strictly Necessary Cookies Require Consent?

**No.** These cookies are essential for your website to function properly:

**Examples:**
- Session management (keeping users logged in)
- Authentication (verifying user identity)
- Security features (preventing fraud)
- Load balancing (distributing traffic)
- Shopping cart functionality

**Key Point:** You don't need consent for these, but you must still disclose them in your privacy policy.

### Do Functional Cookies Require Consent?

**Recommended, but not always required.** These enhance user experience but aren't strictly necessary:

**Examples:**
- Language preferences (English/French)
- Theme settings (dark mode, light mode)
- Shopping cart persistence (remembering items)
- User interface preferences

**Best Practice:** While technically allowed without consent, it's recommended to get user permission.

### Do Analytics Cookies Require Consent?

**Yes.** These track user behavior and always require explicit consent:

**Examples:**
- Google Analytics (page views, user behavior)
- Hotjar (user recordings, heatmaps)
- Microsoft Clarity (session recordings)
- Custom analytics (conversion tracking)

**Important:** Even "anonymized" analytics typically require consent under Canadian law. See [Google's guidance on consent mode](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9976101).

### Do Marketing Cookies Require Consent?

**Yes.** These are used for targeting and advertising and always require consent:

**Examples:**
- Google Ads (conversion tracking, remarketing)
- Facebook Pixel (audience building, ad optimization)
- Retargeting pixels (showing ads to previous visitors)
- Affiliate tracking (commission tracking)

## How Do I Make My Cookie Banner Compliant?

### How Do I Make My Banner Visible and Clear?

Your cookie banner must be:
- Shown before cookies are set
- Written in plain language
- Easy to understand and dismiss

### How Do I Provide Granular Cookie Choices?

Users must be able to:
- Accept all cookies
- Reject non-essential cookies
- Choose specific cookie categories

**Bad example:** "By continuing to browse, you consent to cookies."
**Good example:** "We use cookies for analytics and advertising. You can accept all or customize your preferences."

### Can I Use Pre-Ticked Consent Boxes?

**No.** Under PIPEDA and Law 25:
- Pre-ticked consent boxes are not valid
- Users must actively opt-in to non-essential cookies

### How Do I Make It Easy to Withdraw Consent?

Users must be able to:
- Change their cookie preferences anytime
- Find cookie settings easily (footer link is common)
- Revoke consent without penalty

### Do I Need to Keep Consent Records?

**Yes.** You should document:
- When consent was given
- What the user consented to
- Version of your cookie policy at the time

---

## What Are Common Cookie Consent Mistakes to Avoid?

### What Happens If I Load Cookies Before Consent?

Many websites load Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel immediately, then show a cookie banner. This is not compliant.

**Solution:** Use a consent management platform that only loads tracking scripts after user consent.

### Can I Use "Scroll = Consent" Banners?

**No.** Banners that imply scrolling equals consent are not valid under Canadian law.

**Solution:** Require explicit action (button click) to accept cookies.

### Can I Hide the Reject Button?

**No.** Making the "Accept" button prominent while hiding or de-emphasizing the "Reject" option is a dark pattern and may violate PIPEDA.

**Solution:** Make both accept and reject options equally visible.

### Do I Need a Cookie Policy?

**Yes.** A banner alone isn't enough. You need a detailed cookie policy that explains:
- What cookies you use
- Why you use them
- How long they last
- How users can control them

### Can I Copy a US or EU Banner?

**Not recommended.** US websites often have weaker cookie consent requirements. EU banners (GDPR) are closer but still different from Canadian requirements.

**Solution:** Build a banner specifically designed for Canadian compliance.

## What Are the Penalties for Non-Compliance?

### What Are PIPEDA Penalties?

While PIPEDA historically focused on complaints rather than fines, the **Privacy Commissioner of Canada** can:
- Issue public findings against your organization
- Damage your reputation and trust
- Refer cases to Federal Court (which can award damages)

### What Are CASL Penalties?

CASL has **serious teeth**:
- Up to **$10 million per violation** for businesses
- Up to **$1 million per violation** for individuals
- No warnings required — fines can be issued immediately

### What Are Quebec Law 25 Penalties?

Under Bill 64:
- Up to **$25 million** or **4% of global revenue** (whichever is greater)
- Administrative penalties of **$10,000 per individual** and **$50,000 per company**

**The takeaway:** Non-compliance is expensive and risky.

## How Do I Implement a Compliant Cookie Banner?

### Should I Use a Canadian-Focused Tool?

**Yes, for most businesses.** Look for cookie banner tools that:
- Are designed for **Canadian compliance** (PIPEDA, CASL, Law 25)
- Block cookies until consent is given

- Are easy to customize and brand

### Can I Build My Own Cookie Banner?

**Not recommended.** Building your own cookie banner requires:
- Deep knowledge of Canadian privacy laws
- Technical skills to block cookies until consent
- Ongoing maintenance as laws change

**Most businesses are better off using a specialized tool.**

### What Should I Look for in a Cookie Banner Tool?

Use this checklist to evaluate cookie banner solutions:

- [ ] Banner appears **before** any tracking cookies are set
- [ ] Users can **accept** or **reject** non-essential cookies
- [ ] No pre-ticked boxes
- [ ] Clear, plain-language explanation

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a cookie banner if I only use Google Analytics?

**Yes.** Google Analytics collects personal information (IP addresses, device IDs, browsing behavior) and requires explicit consent under PIPEDA and CASL.

### What's the difference between PIPEDA and GDPR?

While both require consent for cookies, **GDPR** (Europe) is more prescriptive about how consent must be obtained. **PIPEDA** focuses on meaningful consent and transparency. Canadian websites should design for **both** if they have EU users.

### Can I use implied consent for cookies?

**No.** Implied consent (continuing to browse = consent) is **not sufficient** for tracking cookies under PIPEDA. You need explicit, opt-in consent.

### Do I need consent for first-party cookies?

It depends on the cookie's purpose:
- **Session cookies:** No consent required
- **Preference cookies:** Best practice to get consent
- **Analytics cookies:** Consent required

### How often should I update my cookie policy?

Review your cookie policy:
- Whenever you add new tracking tools
- When privacy laws change
- At least **annually**

### What if I only have Canadian visitors?

Even if you only serve Canada, you still need to comply with **PIPEDA** federally and **Law 25** if you have Quebec users.
