## What Is PIPEDA and Why Does Your Website Need to Comply?

**PIPEDA** (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) is Canada's federal privacy law that applies to private-sector organizations collecting, using, or disclosing personal information during commercial activities.

**If you:**
- Run a business website in Canada
- Collect user data (emails, analytics, cookies)
- Use tracking tools (Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel)
- Operate an e-commerce store
- Process customer information

**Then PIPEDA applies to you.**

This comprehensive checklist will help you ensure your website is fully PIPEDA compliant in 2025.

## What Personal Information Collection Requirements Does PIPEDA Have?

### What Personal Information Does PIPEDA Cover?

Personal information under PIPEDA includes:
- ✅ Names and contact information
- ✅ Email addresses
- ✅ Phone numbers
- ✅ IP addresses
- ✅ Device identifiers
- ✅ Browsing behavior and cookies
- ✅ Purchase history
- ✅ Location data
- ✅ Any data that can identify an individual

**Action:** Create a data inventory listing all personal information your website collects.

### Why Must I Document Why I Collect Each Type of Data?

For every piece of personal information, you must have a legitimate purpose:

**Examples:**
- **Email address:** To send order confirmations and newsletters (with consent)
- **IP address:** For security and fraud prevention
- **Cookies:** To analyze traffic and improve user experience

**Action:** Create a data collection justification document.

### How Much Data Can I Collect Under PIPEDA?

PIPEDA requires "data minimization" — only collect information necessary for your stated purposes.

**✅ Good:**
- Collect email for newsletter signup
- Collect shipping address for order delivery

**❌ Bad:**
- Requiring phone number when email is sufficient
- Collecting birthdates for no clear reason
- Asking for more fields than necessary "just in case"

**Action:** Review all forms and remove unnecessary fields.

---

## What Are PIPEDA Consent Requirements?

### What Is Meaningful Consent Under PIPEDA?

PIPEDA requires consent that is:
- **Meaningful:** Users understand what they're consenting to
- **Informed:** You explain how data will be used
- **Voluntary:** Users have a real choice

**For cookies and tracking:**
```
❌ Bad: "By using this site, you consent to cookies."
✅ Good: "We use cookies for analytics and advertising. 
         [Accept All] [Reject Non-Essential] [Customize]"
```

**Action:** Review all consent mechanisms on your website.

### When Do I Need Opt-In Consent?

For sensitive personal information (health data, financial info, precise location), you need **explicit opt-in consent**.

**✅ Opt-in examples:**
- Unchecked checkbox that user must check
- Toggle switch user must turn on
- Button user must click

**❌ Not acceptable:**
- Pre-checked boxes
- Implied consent
- Consent buried in terms of service

**Action:** Ensure sensitive data collection uses explicit opt-in.

### Can I Bundle Multiple Consents Together?

**No.** Don't bundle consents together. If you collect data for multiple purposes, get separate consent for each.

**Example:**
```
□ Yes, send me promotional emails
□ Yes, use my data for analytics
□ Yes, share my data with partners
```

**Action:** Unbundle any combined consent requests.

### How Easy Must It Be to Withdraw Consent?

Users must be able to:
- Withdraw consent as easily as they gave it
- Opt-out of emails with one click
- Delete their account without hassle

**Action:** Add clear opt-out mechanisms (unsubscribe links, account deletion option).

Your cookie banner must:

Your website must NOT set tracking cookies until the user accepts them.

**Test:**
1. Open your site in incognito mode
2. Open DevTools → Network tab
3. Reload page
4. Check if Google Analytics/Facebook Pixel fires before you click "Accept"

If yes, you're not compliant.

**Action:** Implement cookie blocking until consent is given.

Organize cookies into categories:
- **Strictly Necessary:** No consent required (security, sessions)
- **Functional:** Preferences (consent recommended)
- **Analytics:** Google Analytics, Hotjar (consent required)
- **Marketing:** Facebook Pixel, Google Ads (consent required)

**Action:** List all cookies by category in your privacy policy.

### How Do I Provide Granular Cookie Control?

- Accept all cookies
- Reject non-essential cookies
- Choose specific categories

**Example:**
```
Cookie Preferences:
☑ Strictly Necessary (always active)
□ Functional Cookies
□ Analytics Cookies
□ Marketing Cookies

[Save Preferences]
```

**Action:** Ensure your cookie banner offers granular controls.
