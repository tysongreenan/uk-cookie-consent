## What is PIPEDA and Why Does Your Website Need to Comply?

**PIPEDA** (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) is Canada's federal privacy law that applies to private-sector organizations collecting, using, or disclosing personal information during commercial activities.

**If you:**
- Run a business website in Canada
- Collect user data (emails, analytics, cookies)
- Use tracking tools (Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel)
- Operate an e-commerce store
- Process customer information

**Then PIPEDA applies to you.**

This comprehensive checklist will help you ensure your website is fully PIPEDA compliant in 2025.

## PIPEDA Compliance Checklist

### ✅ Part 1: Personal Information Collection

#### □ Identify What Personal Information You Collect

Personal information under PIPEDA includes:
- ✅ Names and contact information
- ✅ Email addresses
- ✅ Phone numbers
- ✅ IP addresses
- ✅ Device identifiers
- ✅ Browsing behavior and cookies
- ✅ Purchase history
- ✅ Location data
- ✅ Any data that can identify an individual

**Action:** Create a data inventory listing all personal information your website collects.

#### □ Document Why You Collect Each Type of Data

For every piece of personal information, you must have a legitimate purpose:

**Examples:**
- **Email address:** To send order confirmations and newsletters (with consent)
- **IP address:** For security and fraud prevention
- **Cookies:** To analyze traffic and improve user experience

**Action:** Create a data collection justification document.

#### □ Collect Only What You Need

PIPEDA requires "data minimization" — only collect information necessary for your stated purposes.

**✅ Good:**
- Collect email for newsletter signup
- Collect shipping address for order delivery

**❌ Bad:**
- Requiring phone number when email is sufficient
- Collecting birthdates for no clear reason
- Asking for more fields than necessary "just in case"

**Action:** Review all forms and remove unnecessary fields.

### ✅ Part 2: Consent Requirements

#### □ Get Meaningful Consent Before Collecting Data

PIPEDA requires consent that is:
- **Meaningful:** Users understand what they're consenting to
- **Informed:** You explain how data will be used
- **Voluntary:** Users have a real choice

**For cookies and tracking:**
```
❌ Bad: "By using this site, you consent to cookies."
✅ Good: "We use cookies for analytics and advertising. 
         [Accept All] [Reject Non-Essential] [Customize]"
```

**Action:** Review all consent mechanisms on your website.

#### □ Use Opt-In Consent for Sensitive Data

For sensitive personal information (health data, financial info, precise location), you need **explicit opt-in consent**.

**✅ Opt-in examples:**
- Unchecked checkbox that user must check
- Toggle switch user must turn on
- Button user must click

**❌ Not acceptable:**
- Pre-checked boxes
- Implied consent
- Consent buried in terms of service

**Action:** Ensure sensitive data collection uses explicit opt-in.

#### □ Separate Consent for Different Purposes

Don't bundle consents together. If you collect data for multiple purposes, get separate consent for each.

**Example:**
```
□ Yes, send me promotional emails
□ Yes, use my data for analytics
□ Yes, share my data with partners
```

**Action:** Unbundle any combined consent requests.

#### □ Make Withdrawal of Consent Easy

Users must be able to:
- Withdraw consent as easily as they gave it
- Opt-out of emails with one click
- Delete their account without hassle

**Action:** Add clear opt-out mechanisms (unsubscribe links, account deletion option).

### ✅ Part 3: Cookie Consent

#### □ Implement a Compliant Cookie Banner

Your cookie banner must:
- ✅ Appear before non-essential cookies are set
- ✅ Explain what cookies do
- ✅ Offer "Accept," "Reject," and "Customize" options
- ✅ Not use pre-checked boxes
- ✅ Link to your privacy policy

**Action:** Install a PIPEDA-compliant cookie banner (like [Cookie Banner Generator](https://www.cookie-banner.ca)).

#### □ Block Cookies Until Consent

Your website must NOT set tracking cookies until the user accepts them.

**Test:**
1. Open your site in incognito mode
2. Open DevTools → Network tab
3. Reload page
4. Check if Google Analytics/Facebook Pixel fires before you click "Accept"

If yes, you're not compliant.

**Action:** Implement cookie blocking until consent is given.

#### □ Categorize Your Cookies

Organize cookies into categories:
- **Strictly Necessary:** No consent required (security, sessions)
- **Functional:** Preferences (consent recommended)
- **Analytics:** Google Analytics, Hotjar (consent required)
- **Marketing:** Facebook Pixel, Google Ads (consent required)

**Action:** List all cookies by category in your privacy policy.

#### □ Provide Granular Cookie Control

Users must be able to:
- Accept all cookies
- Reject non-essential cookies
- Choose specific categories

**Example:**
```
Cookie Preferences:
☑ Strictly Necessary (always active)
□ Functional Cookies
□ Analytics Cookies
□ Marketing Cookies

[Save Preferences]
```

**Action:** Ensure your cookie banner offers granular controls.

### ✅ Part 4: Privacy Policy

#### □ Create a Comprehensive Privacy Policy

Your privacy policy must include:
- ✅ What personal information you collect
- ✅ Why you collect it (purposes)
- ✅ How you use it
- ✅ Who you share it with (third parties)
- ✅ How long you keep it
- ✅ How you protect it (security measures)
- ✅ User rights under PIPEDA
- ✅ How to contact you with privacy questions

**Action:** Write or update your privacy policy.

#### □ Make Your Privacy Policy Easy to Find

PIPEDA requires that privacy policies be:
- Easily accessible
- Written in plain language
- Available at or before the point of collection

**Best practices:**
- Link in website footer
- Link in signup/checkout forms
- Use clear language (avoid legal jargon)

**Action:** Add privacy policy links throughout your site.

#### □ Explain Cookie Usage in Detail

Your privacy policy should include a dedicated "Cookies" section:

**Required information:**
- List of cookies by name
- Purpose of each cookie
- Duration of each cookie
- Third parties involved (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- How users can manage/delete cookies

**Action:** Add detailed cookie information to your privacy policy.

#### □ List Third Parties and Data Sharing

If you share data with third parties, you must disclose:
- Who they are (company names)
- What data you share
- Why you share it
- Link to their privacy policies

**Common third parties:**
- Google Analytics
- Facebook
- Payment processors (Stripe, PayPal)
- Email providers (Mailchimp, SendGrid)
- Hosting providers

**Action:** List all third parties in your privacy policy.

### ✅ Part 5: User Rights

#### □ Allow Users to Access Their Data

Under PIPEDA, individuals have the right to:
- Know what personal information you have about them
- Request access to their data
- Receive a copy of their data

**Action:** Create a process for users to request their data (email form or account dashboard).

#### □ Allow Users to Correct Their Data

Users have the right to:
- Correct inaccurate information
- Update outdated information

**Action:** Provide account settings or a contact method for data corrections.

#### □ Provide a Data Deletion Option

Users can request deletion of their personal information, subject to legal retention requirements.

**Action:** Add account deletion functionality or a deletion request process.

#### □ Explain User Rights in Your Privacy Policy

Your privacy policy must explain that users can:
- Access their personal information
- Correct inaccurate data
- Withdraw consent
- Request deletion
- File a complaint with the Privacy Commissioner

**Action:** Add a "Your Privacy Rights" section to your policy.

### ✅ Part 6: Security Safeguards

#### □ Implement Appropriate Security Measures

PIPEDA requires you to protect personal information with safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the data.

**Security checklist:**
- ✅ HTTPS encryption (SSL certificate)
- ✅ Secure password storage (hashing, not plain text)
- ✅ Regular software updates
- ✅ Firewall protection
- ✅ Access controls (limit who can access data)
- ✅ Regular backups
- ✅ Secure third-party integrations

**Action:** Conduct a security audit of your website.

#### □ Have a Data Breach Response Plan

If personal information is compromised, PIPEDA requires you to:
- Report breaches to the Privacy Commissioner (if real risk of significant harm)
- Notify affected individuals
- Keep records of breaches

**Action:** Create a data breach response plan.

#### □ Use Secure Payment Processing

If you process payments:
- ✅ Use PCI-DSS compliant payment processors
- ✅ Never store full credit card numbers
- ✅ Use tokenization
- ✅ Implement fraud detection

**Action:** Ensure your payment processor is compliant.

### ✅ Part 7: Data Retention

#### □ Define Data Retention Periods

PIPEDA requires you to keep personal information only as long as necessary for its stated purpose.

**Guidelines:**
- **Active customers:** Keep data as long as the relationship exists
- **Inactive customers:** Delete after 1-3 years (unless legally required to keep)
- **Cookies:** Typically 1-2 years, then require new consent
- **Analytics:** Aggregate and anonymize after 6-12 months

**Action:** Document retention periods for each data type.

#### □ Implement Data Deletion Procedures

Create processes to:
- Automatically delete outdated data
- Remove inactive accounts
- Purge old analytics data
- Respond to deletion requests

**Action:** Set up automated data deletion where possible.

### ✅ Part 8: Employee Training

#### □ Train Staff on PIPEDA Compliance

Employees who handle personal information must understand:
- What PIPEDA is
- Your organization's privacy policies
- How to handle data securely
- How to respond to privacy requests

**Action:** Conduct privacy training for relevant staff.

#### □ Designate a Privacy Officer

PIPEDA doesn't require a dedicated officer for small businesses, but it's best practice to designate someone responsible for:
- Handling privacy inquiries
- Managing data requests
- Ensuring ongoing compliance

**Action:** Appoint a privacy point of contact.

### ✅ Part 9: Quebec-Specific Requirements (Law 25)

If you have users in Quebec, you must also comply with **Bill 64 (Law 25)**, which is stricter than PIPEDA:

#### □ Conduct Privacy Impact Assessments

For high-risk data processing, Law 25 requires privacy impact assessments.

#### □ Implement Stronger Consent

Law 25 requires:
- **Explicit opt-in** for cookies (not just implied)
- **Separate consent** for each purpose
- **Clear, simple language**

#### □ Respond to Requests Within 30 Days

Law 25 mandates response to access requests within 30 days.

#### □ Report Breaches

Law 25 requires reporting data breaches to authorities and affected individuals.

**Action:** If you have Quebec users, ensure Law 25 compliance.

### ✅ Part 10: Documentation and Records

#### □ Keep Consent Records

Document:
- When consent was obtained
- What the user consented to
- How consent was obtained
- Version of privacy policy at the time

**Action:** Implement consent logging.

#### □ Maintain Privacy Policy Versions

Keep historical versions of your privacy policy to prove what users agreed to.

**Action:** Use version control for your privacy policy.

#### □ Document Data Processing Activities

Keep records of:
- What data you collect
- Why you collect it
- Who has access to it
- Where it's stored
- How long you keep it

**Action:** Create a data processing inventory.

## PIPEDA Enforcement and Penalties

### How PIPEDA is Enforced

Unlike GDPR (which has massive fines), PIPEDA enforcement focuses on:
1. **Complaints** to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada
2. **Investigations** and findings
3. **Public reports** (reputational damage)
4. **Federal Court actions** (if needed)

### Consequences of Non-Compliance

- ❌ Privacy Commissioner findings against your organization
- ❌ Reputation damage
- ❌ Federal Court orders to comply
- ❌ Potential damages awarded to complainants
- ❌ Loss of customer trust

While PIPEDA doesn't have GDPR-style fines (yet), the **reputational damage** and **customer trust loss** can be devastating.

### Recent PIPEDA Cases

**Examples of enforcement:**
- **Facebook (Meta):** Found to have violated PIPEDA multiple times
- **Cadillac Fairview:** Fined for undisclosed facial recognition in malls
- **Tim Hortons:** Found to have collected excessive location data
